      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">We are a team of individuals from UCONN and Trinity College that created the extension “MobyPhish” to help the world get better at protecting themselves from phishing attacks.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">This project aims to address vulnerabilities in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that may undermine web connection confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Failures in PKI can enable attackers to forge web (SSL/TLS) certificates and perform website spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Such attacks can lead to identity theft, surveillance, and the compromise of sensitive information.
        Our objective is to empower end-users to identify and mitigate these threats through a user-centric solution, a browser extension designed to improve users’ cybersecurity awareness and skills, particularly regarding PKI. 

      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The overarching goal is to enable users to make informed decisions and adopt safer Internet habits through continuous, test-based cybersecurity training embedded within their daily Internet use.
The project consists of two phases. The first phase involves a usability study to evaluate the extension’s effectiveness against phishing attacks and to gather data on its practicality and impact on user behavior. Study insights will inform the second phase focused on refining the extension based on the feedback and data obtained, with the goal of developing an improved version for broader public release. This comprehensive approach will provide valuable insights into the intersection of usability, privacy, and security.

      <h1>Our Extension</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">MobyPhish is a user-centric browser extension with the objective to empower users to identify and mitigate phishing attacks. Currently, MobyPhish is a prototype developed as part of a research project with University of Connecticut and Trinity College with the overarching goal of educating users and giving them greater control over the security of their online activities.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">MobyPhish allows users to establish a list of protected websites, which they can select based on their preferences or on suggestions from the extension. Once a website is added to the protected website list, MobyPhish ensures that users verify, via clicking the extension icon, the site before attempting to interact with it. Upon clicking the extension icon, MobyPhish performs several checks and presents security information to the users in a digestible way. Through the use of MobyPhish, we hope users improve their knowledge and ability to protect themselves against phishing attacks by forming a habit of verifying websites. </p>
      <p class="w3-text-black">Getting started with and using MobyPhish is simple! 
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">First, add your protected websites by clicking on the fish icon and clicking “save new protected site” you should get a confirmation message. We recommend adding websites that you enter personal and sensitive information into like your banking website.
        </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Then, you should click the moby icon every time you enter a website you’ve recorded as protected. This allows MobyPhish to check and present security information. If you interact with a protected website before you click on Moby, then the website will be blocked until MobyPhish is clicked.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-black">After you click MobyPhish, one of three messages will pop up.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">“PUT IN CORRECT QUOTE” —Users should continue like normal, just with some additional confidence about their secure connection </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">“PUT IN CORRECT QUOTE” —Users should do some additional research into the specific website or try to reconnect later. </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">“PUT IN CORRECT QUOTE” —This message could appear because the user either wanted to add a new protected website or the user encountered a phishing scam. If users encounter a phishing scam they should report the scam at the bottom of the extension popup. MobyPhish will warn you if you visit the phishing website again.
